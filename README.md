css-spinner
===========

Spinner, useful for loading, based on CSS3, compiled with LESS

Creates a CSS3-based loader element that performs better than loader.gif alternatives.

## Usage

Use with less.js in your HTML (see index.html) or use a less compiler to compile into css server-side.

## Settings

Use settings.less to define variables for color, size and amount of spikes.
Make sure the number of LI-elements in HTML matches @loaderSpikes as defined in settings.less!

Any number between 6 and 20 is adviced.
