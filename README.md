css-spinner
===========

Spinner, useful for loading, based on CSS3, compiled with LESS

Creates a CSS3-based loader element that performs better than loader.gif alternatives.

## Usage

Use with less.js in your HTML (see index.html) or use the less compiler to compile into css server-side.

## Settings

In settings.less you can define several variables for color, size and amount of spikes.
Make sure the number of <li>-elements in your HTML matches the @loaderSpikes that you set in settings.less.
